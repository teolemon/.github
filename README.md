Hello World :-)<br><br>
My name is Pierre Slamich, an eligible single, better known as @teolemon (a very elaborate French pun and hackername, stolen from my little sister).<br>
I'm the co-founder of the @openfoodfacts NGO. To join the fun and food fight using code: https://github.com/openfoodfacts<br>
Previously, I've lurked at @sciencespo, @google and @jobmind<br><br>
